        I am a finance and accounting professional with over 20 years experience.
        I am proficient in using T-sql to extract and analyze data from SQL Server databases.
        I recently completed a 6 month certificate program through the University of Utah in full stack development
        which has given me additional capability to interact with APIs and create interactive web applications
        using a finance and accounting perspective.
